          The fund has been designed with exclusivity in mind and will only ever
          have 99 participants. Once this number has been reached no further
          investors will be onboarded unless a current investor cashes out for
          good thus making a space available for new blood.


          All investors will receive a custom investor card manufactured from
          gold as well as a personalized NFT backed with $1000 of cryptocurrency
          which they are able to keep or melt when they so desire.
