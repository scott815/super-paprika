          The fund has been designed with exclusivity in mind and will only ever
          have 99 participants. Once this number has been reached no further
          investors will be onboarded unless a current investor cashes out for
          good thus making a space available for new blood.


          All investors will receive a custom investor card manufactured from
          gold as well as a personalized NFT backed with $1000 of cryptocurrency
          which they are able to keep or melt when they so desire.

          The fund will incur no annual management fee. Further, there will be
          no performance fees attached due to the passive nature of the fund. As
          a result of zero performance fee, there is no specific benchmark the
          fund aims to outperform. For comparative purposes however, the fund
          will be benchmarked against the performance of the top 20 cryptoassets
          equally weighted and Bitcoin itself.
